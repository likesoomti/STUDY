# Cut the sticks

## problem 

You are given  sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive integer. 
A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.

Suppose we have six sticks of the following lengths:

5 4 4 2 2 8

Then, in one cut operation we make a cut of length 2 from each of the six sticks. 
For the next cut operation four sticks are left (of non-zero length), whose lengths are the following: 

3 2 2 6
The above step is repeated until no sticks are left.

Given the length of  sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operations.

Note: For each cut operation, you have to recalcuate the length of smallest sticks (excluding zero-length sticks).

## solve


```javascript

  
    // sort array 
    arr = arr.sort(function(a, b){return a - b});
    
    // min value count 
    var count = 0;
    
       while(arr.length>0){
      
            count = 0 ; 
            var min = arr[0];
            for(var i = 0 ; i < arr.length ; i++){
                if(arr[i] == min ){
                   count++;
                }
                arr[i]-=min;
            }
            console.log(arr.length)
            
            // remove array min sticks
            arr.splice(0,count);
           
      
        }


```
